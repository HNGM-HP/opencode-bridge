- **🧙 First-run Onboarding**: First Web visit pops a guided wizard (language → pick a starter platform → driver.js highlight tour over the left sidebar). Skippable and won't reappear; use the top-right "Help" menu anytime to reopen README and platform docs
- **💻 TUI Terminal Wizard**: `opencode-bridge` / `opencode-bridge init` — full configuration in a pure CLI environment (Chinese + English, sharing the same SQLite config file with the web UI)
- **🔌 Decoupled web toggle**: turn off the web admin from the TUI while keeping platform adapters running (suited for hardened intranet deployments)
- **🆓 No login, no password**: the admin panel ships without account/password auth — secure access at the network layer (firewall / reverse proxy) instead

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Desktop App (Windows / macOS, Recommended)

Download the installer for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/HNGM-HP/opencode-bridge/releases):

| Platform | Installer | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Windows | `.exe` | Double-click to install. If "unrecognized app" appears, click "Run anyway" |
| macOS | `.dmg` | Drag to Applications. First launch: right-click → Open |

The app launches your browser at `http://localhost:4098` automatically. **On first visit a guided onboarding wizard pops up**:

1. Choose UI language (中文 / English)
2. Pick a starter platform to connect (skippable)
3. driver.js highlight tour over the left navigation (skippable, won't reappear)

After onboarding, the top-right "Help" menu lets you reopen the README and platform-specific docs anytime.

---

### NPM Install (Linux / Server / Headless)

```bash
npm install -g opencode-bridge
```

> Or `npx opencode-bridge` to run without installation.

#### Subcommands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `opencode-bridge` | **First run** → enters the TUI wizard; **already configured** → starts the bridge service |
| `opencode-bridge init` | Force re-enter the TUI wizard (re-configure / edit any setting) |
| `opencode-bridge start` | Skip the wizard and start the service immediately |
| `opencode-bridge --config-dir /path` | Override config directory (default `./data`) |
| `opencode-bridge --version` / `--help` | Show version / usage |

#### TUI wizard flow

1. **Language selection** (中文 / English, persisted)
2. **How would you like to configure?**
   - Configure here in the terminal (recommended for headless)
   - Launch the web admin UI and configure in a browser
   - Skip — start the service now
   - Show help / documentation
3. **Polling main menu**: pick the primary platform → enable/disable platforms & set credentials → OpenCode connection → group behaviour & allow-list → reliability / cron / heartbeat → output display → web admin on/off → help → save & start service / exit

> The TUI and the Web panel share the same SQLite store (`data/config.db`); changes on either side are visible immediately on the other.

#### Run platforms without exposing the web UI

Toggle "Web admin UI" off in the TUI, or use the env var:

```bash
BRIDGE_DISABLE_ADMIN=1 opencode-bridge start
```

Suited for hardened intranets — platform adapters keep relaying messages while the web port stays closed.

---

### Source Deployment (Developers)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HNGM-HP/opencode-bridge.git
cd opencode-bridge
```

#### One-Click Deployment

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
chmod +x ./scripts/deploy.sh
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
.\scripts\deploy.ps1
```

This will automatically: detect Node.js / OpenCode → install dependencies and compile → generate config file.

#### Start Service

```bash
# Linux/macOS
./scripts/start.sh

# Windows PowerShell
.\scripts\start.ps1

# Development Mode
npm run dev
```

---

After service starts, access the Web configuration panel:

```
http://localhost:4098
```

> The admin panel ships without account/password authentication. Make sure port 4098 is exposed only on a trusted network, or front it with a reverse proxy / firewall.

---

## ❓ Common Installation Issues

### macOS: "App is damaged" Error

**Problem**:
```
"OpenCode Bridge" is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to the Trash.
```

**Reason**:
- macOS security mechanism (Gatekeeper) blocks unsigned apps
- This is a free open-source project without Apple Developer certificate

**Solutions** (choose one):

#### Method 1: Right-click to Open (Recommended)
```
1. Right-click on "OpenCode Bridge.app"
2. Hold the "Option" key on your keyboard
3. Double-click the "Open" button
4. Click "Open" in the confirmation dialog
```

#### Method 2: System Settings Override
```
1. Open "System Settings" → "Privacy & Security"
2. Find the "OpenCode Bridge was blocked" message
3. Click "Open Anyway"
```

#### Method 3: Command Line Remove Quarantine
```bash
# Execute in Terminal (replace with actual path)
xattr -cr /Applications/OpenCode\ Bridge.app
```

**After this one-time operation**, you can launch normally by double-clicking.

---

### Windows: "Unrecognized App" Warning

**Problem**:
```
Windows protected your PC
Microsoft Defender SmartScreen blocked an unrecognized app
```

**Solution**:
1. Click "More info"
2. Click "Run anyway"

**Note**: This is normal Windows Defender protection for unsigned apps. Confirm once and it will run normally.

---

### Can't Access Management Panel After Launch

**Troubleshooting Steps**:

1. **Check if app is running**:
   - **Windows**: Look for OpenCode Bridge icon in system tray (bottom-right)
   - **macOS**: Look for icon in top menu bar

2. **Manually open management panel**:
   ```
   Visit in browser: http://localhost:4098
   ```

3. **Check port usage**:
   ```bash
   # Windows PowerShell
   netstat -ano | findstr :4098

   # macOS/Linux
   lsof -i :4098
   ```

4. **Check whether the web admin was disabled**: the TUI can disable the web panel. To re-enable, run `opencode-bridge init` and toggle "Web admin UI" back on, or make sure neither `WEB_ADMIN_DISABLED=true` nor `BRIDGE_DISABLE_ADMIN=1` is set.

5. **View log files**:
   - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/opencode-bridge/logs/`
   - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/opencode-bridge/logs/`
