## Notes

### Compatible Commands
The following compatible commands are retained: `/session`, `/new`, `/new-session`, `/clear`.

### Discord Features
- `///create_chat` uses Discord dropdown menus and modals to complement session control experience.
- `///clear` in session channels (topic with `oc-session:`) will attempt to delete the channel directly; if permissions are insufficient, only unbind.
- `!` passthrough only supports whitelisted commands; interactive editors like `vi`/`vim`/`nano` are not passed through.

### Effort Override
- Single message temporary override can use `#low` / `#high` / `#max` / `#xhigh` at message start (effective for current message only).
- Effort priority: `#temporary override` > `///effort session default` > model default.

### List Format
- `///sessions` list column order is fixed: `Working Directory | SessionID | OpenCode Session Name | Bound Group Details | Current Session Status`.
- `///create_chat` dropdown label order is fixed: `Workspace / Session Short ID / Brief`, displayed aggregated by workspace.
